# gender_classification

<h3>Overview</h3>

The code uses the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library to train six 
diverent algorithms on a small dataset of body metrics (height, weight and shoe_size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict
the gender of someone give a novel set of body metrics.

This is my first machine learning python script
